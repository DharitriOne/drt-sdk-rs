# Multisig Smart Contract (MSC)

## Abstract
Cryptocurrencies can be one of the safest ways to store and manage wealth and value. By safeguarding a short list of words, the so-called seed or recovery phrase, anyone can protect thousands or millions of dollars in wealth and rest assured that no hacker or government can take it from them. In practice, it’s never so easy.

One problem is that single-signature addresses rely on protecting a single private key.
